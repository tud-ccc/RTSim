; NVMain use CLK and CPUFreq to do the synchronization. The ratio CLK/CPUFreq
; is actually used. So a simple CLK=1 and CPUFreq=4 still works for simulation. 
; However, it is straightforward to make it informative. ; For DRAM Cache, this should be the system bus frequency from gem5

; Memory device timing parameters (in memory cycle)

; RTM has Shift: 2.14192ns, RD: 1.61338ns and WR: 4.84522ns. 
; If we consider the default 400 MHz from other nvmain config files, 
; we need 1, 1 and 2 cycles respectively for shift, read, and write.
; we introduce the following parameters to represent these operations. 
; NOTE: The parameters introduced are not actual memroy parameters but are 
;       introduced to mimmick the actual operation. Similar to the energy model (below), 
;       this latency model takes flat values that catter for all sub operations.
